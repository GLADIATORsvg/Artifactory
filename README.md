# Artifactory
Part 1
We have a Maven project, it is in archive `artifact.zip`.

It's important for us to upload this project to GitHub Packages, as this will allow us to utilize it as a dependency in upcoming projects.

    Unzip artifact.zip
    Create a repository on GitHub
    Configure the settings.xml file
    Configure the pom.xml file
    Deploy the artifact to GitHub Packages, use settings for Maven from the file settings.xml
